# Cat vs Dog Classifier (Teachable Machine Project)



# Task Instructions
- Train an image recognition model using Teachable Machine by Google.
- Use at least two classes (Cat and Dog).
- Evaluate the model.
- Download the trained model in TensorFlow → Keras format.
- Write a Python script that loads the model, accepts an input image, and predicts its class.
- Submit the Python script, the exported model files, and a screenshot of the output.

# What I did
 I trained the model on Teachable Machine with two classes: Cat and Dog.  
 I exported the model in TensorFlow Keras format (.h5).  
 I wrote a script (Colab notebook / Python script) that loads the model and predicts image class.  
 I tested the model and included a screenshot of the result.  

# Files included
- `keras_model.h5` — The exported trained model.
- `labels.txt` — The class labels used.
- `script.py` or `notebook.ipynb` — The code used for prediction.
- `output.png` — Screenshot showing the result of prediction.
- `README.md` — This documentation file.
